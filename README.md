## Tools and Frameworks
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - Boilerplate to set up a modern web app by running one command

- [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!

-  [react-icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com/) - Include popular icons in your React projects easly with react-icons, which utilizes ES6 imports that allows you to include only the icons that your project is using

- [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web) - Declarative Routing for React.js
